export const morning_journal = `Hello [AIs Name], every morning, Id like to engage in a reflective morning journaling session with you. Assist me in this process by Prompting me to list a few things Im grateful for today. Asking about my intentions and goals for the day ahead. Providing space for free writing, allowing me to express any feelings, thoughts, or dreams from the night before. Offering a positive affirmation or suggesting one based on my current feelings or situation. Encouraging visualization of my days success and how that would feel. Inquiring about any reflections or takeaways from the previous day. Concluding with an inspiring quote or positive thought to carry with me throughout my day. Lets make this a fulfilling experience, focusing on authenticity, intentionality, and positive momentum for the day ahead.`
