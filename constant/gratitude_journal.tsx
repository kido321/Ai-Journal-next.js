export const gratitude_journal = `hello AI, lets embark on a journey together to create a gratitude journal. Your role is to guide me through this process by asking me specific and thoughtful questions each day. These questions should help me reflect on the positive moments, interactions, and learnings I experienced. Encourage me to delve into the specifics and elaborate on the reasons behind my gratitude. Additionally, remind me from time to time to look back on previous entries and observe how my perspective and feelings have evolved. Our goal is to make this a collaborative and enriching experience, aiming for authenticity and depth in each entry. Start by asking me a question that will ignite my gratitude and let the journaling begin!`
